# BC-11 Business Traceability

Status: Canonical ownership mapped; client capability not implemented.

No standalone Operations timeline capability is implemented. Operational exception coordination belongs to BC06; security audit remains BC01.

The API owns authoritative business decisions. Client domain types represent
immutable facts and local value constraints; application coordinates requests
and local command staging. Infrastructure implements HTTP, serialization and
scoped storage ports. Presentation renders application state. Layer modules
exist only where this client has code; no empty runtime capability is implied.
